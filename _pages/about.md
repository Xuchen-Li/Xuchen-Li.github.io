# üë®üèª‚Äçüíª About Me

I am **Xuchen Li <font face="Ê•∑‰Ωì" >(ÊùéÊó≠ÂÆ∏)</font>**, an incoming Ph.D. student at **<a href="http://english.ia.cas.cn/">Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)</a>**, supervised by **<a href="https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~huangkaiqi?language=en">Prof. Kaiqi Huang</a>** (IAPR Fellow) at **<a href="http://www.crise.ia.ac.cn/"> Center for Research on Intelligent System and Engineering (CRISE)</a>**.

Currently, I am a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at **<a href="https://scs.bupt.edu.cn/"> School of Computer Science (SCS)</a>** at **<a href="https://www.bupt.edu.cn/"> Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)</a>**.

I am very grateful to work with **<a href="https://huuuuusy.github.io/">Dr. Shiyu Hu</a>**, which has a significant impact on me. I am also grateful to grow up and study with my twin brother Xuzhao Li, which is a truly unique and special experience for me.

# üî¨ Research Interests

## Visual Object Tracking (VOT)

- Research in visual object tracking algorithms within diverse scenes, exemplified by benchmarks like GIT, LaSOT, and GOT-10k, aims to enhance the understanding and performance of single object tracking in various scenarios.
- Delving into the robustness and generalization aspects of single object tracking algorithms is crucial. This research investigates the algorithms' ability to adapt across diverse scenarios, ensuring consistent and reliable performance.

## Visual Language Tracking (VLT)

- Within the domain of Visual Language Tracking (VLT), there is a focus on multi-modal tracking, addressing challenges related to integrating visual and linguistic information for improved tracking accuracy.
- Research in VLT extends to tasks involving comprehensive video understanding. This encompasses efforts to enhance the algorithms' capability to interpret and contextualize objects in videos based on linguistic input.
- The exploration of human-computer interaction patterns employs Large Language Models (LLMs) in conjunction with visual language tracking as a proxy task. This approach facilitates a deeper understanding of user interactions with visual content, contributing to the development of interactions that are more intuitive and user-friendly.
